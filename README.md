# PokemonTeam
This project utilizes the tools and languages of node, express, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and APIs to allow users different Pokemon team functionality. The user can create a Pokemon team and save it in a Mongo database, pick two Pokemon to fight and show the winner, and allow for a Pokemon Pokedex lookup using the Pokemon API using only the Pokemon's Pokedex number.

The site can be run locally using the "node ./pokemonServer.js PORTNUMBER" where you can select any PORTNUMBER. All of the local node modules are already installed, and the Pokemon API used is "https://pokeapi.co/".
